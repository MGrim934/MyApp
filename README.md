# MyMoodMonitorApp
This app is called "My Mood Monitor".

It is a second year C# programming project by Mark Grimes. It was designed primarily for pc usage.

The goal of the app is to let a user store various "journal entries" of their mood and activities they are participating in,
or thinking about.
The app lets you sort your previous entries by selecting a specific entry
and then choosing whether to find more with a similar emotion or with a similar activity.

I attempted to include various things learned during the semester. There is a basic German translation option, some basic json file intake, it also stores a data file locally of the user's previous entries that is persistent when you relaunch the program.

# MyApp
This app is called "My Mood Monitor"
It is a second year C# programming project.

The goal of the app is to let a user store various "journal entries" of their mood and activities they are participating in,
or thinking about.
The app lets you sort your previous entries by selecting a specific entry
and then choosing whether to find more with a similar emotion or with a similar activity.
